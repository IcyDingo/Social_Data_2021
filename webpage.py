* [New York Neighborhood Areas](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTA-/cpf4-rkhq)
* [New York Population per Neighborhood](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/swpk-hqdp)
* [Weather Data](https://www.noaa.gov/)

The design behind the UI presented in the webpage is based upon a multi-page comic book genre style. Each page is devided into the respective sections of the analysis which are:

* Welcome Page 
* Collision Analysis 
* Borough Analysis
* Neighborhood Analysis
* Collision Forecasting
* Conclusions and Discussions

The motivation behind the project is to understand the seasonality of the collisions that are happening in NYC and investigate if there are any neighborhoods with a high number of collisions relatively to their population.
 Afterwards, if such neighborhoods are indetified,  a more proactive plan of placing the emergency services around the city can be made.

- According to the first two digrams, the most injuries happen to motorists, meaning people that have a motorvehicle, which makes sense, because, most of the times, they are the ones
 involved in a collision. However, the most deaths occur to pedestrian. This might be the case because 
motorists, being inside the car, are more protected compared to pedestrians and cyclists that are way more exposed than the former.
- According to yearly pattern, it can be seen that the number of injuries increased between 2016 and 2019 compared to previous years. 
- Between 2014 and 2018 an downward trend can be seen for the number of persons who died except of the year 2017. In 2017, a terrorist attack happended in NYC resulting in 18 deaths. [Source](https://www.vox.com/2017/10/31/16587120/new-york-city-terror-attack-what-we-know) 
- The number of deaths is increasing over the weekend and over the nights, which can be explained of the alcohol consumption during night-life. 
- In 2020, an overall decline can be observed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- According to the monthly patterns, the first 3 months of the year (January-March) have the least number for both injuries and deaths.

Finally, the last two graphs describe the cars that are involved in **all** traffic collisions and the contributing factors respectively:

- The most common vehicles involved in collisions are Sedans and passenger vehicles. 
- The most common contributing factors are the distraction/inattention of the driver, driving too close, and failure to yield right-of-the-way.""",unsafe_allow_html=True)

The time series analysis was done using [FB Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) which a high level API based on [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) which uses Statistical Modeling techniques for time-series forecasting. [Paper](https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/)

The forecasting was done in 2 main phases:
* Forecasting for the whole NYC before corona
* Forecasting for each NYC Neighborhood

For the first graph, The reasoning behind forecasting collisions for the whole city, before corona, is to get a holistic view of what would have happened regarding traffic collisions 
if there was no corona pandemic. It is clear from the graph that if the pandemic did not happend the collisions would follow on a slightly increasing trend. That's **123.000** less collisions during year 2020.""", unsafe_allow_html=True)

    The comparison was made to 2018 for the actual values wich is consider to be a normal year. The neighborhood with an increasing trend can be categorised as a 
    possible hot spot area were more collisions are forecasted to happen. The areas which are forecasted to have an increasing amount of trafic collisions during the year 2021 
    are the **Mid-Town Manhattan** and the south part of **Saten Island**. Acording to this results more emphasis should be put on those areas regading emergency services placing in 
    the city in order to aid proactivness. 

It is important to note that that the **Saten Island** area was not a hot spot on on the previous descriptive analysis and based on the model it is expected to have an 
increased amount of collsions. A test of this forecasting approach would be to check the actual collision result once the year 2021 is concluded and compare them to the 
forecasted ones.""")

    Looking at the graph bellow, on Wednesdays during mid-day there is a higher influence if it is raining heavyly. This information would indicate that, in the highlighted 
    neighborhoods from the map above, there is a higher collision probability in those areas. Based on this approach, it can now be indicated not only the location but also the 
    time and weather condition where the emergenices services could be placed proactively. 

Regarding the weather influence, it is assumed that when there is rain the chance of an accident is higher. Based on this assumption a weight was calculated for each collision.

    st.markdown("""The main takeaways from this project are:
* Collisions follow a highly predictable trend with high seasonality as shown from the analysis.
* There is a very small precentage of people that are killed in an accident in NYC (less that 0.1%).
* The hotspot collision area of the city is Midtown Manhattan. 
* Most collisions happen during mid-day hours but the most fatal ones happened at night, probably due to alchool consumption.
* During the week the activity is more or less the same, peaking in Fridays. In the weekends the activity drops about 25% but fatal accidents increase by 20%.
* Fatal accident include mostly pedestrians and not motorists.
* 1 out of 5 accidents include an injury.
* Collision prediction can be used in aidding emergency services proactiveness.
* Normalizing the collision according to population of the neighborhood reveals a clearer view of the situation since it's an apples to apples comparison ;). 

Predicting collision on the exact location is a difficult task but it can be made easier by making a prediction for each neighborhod. The model that was used has an r-square of 0.95
 which a very good performance. This is possible due the exploitation of seasonality in the dataset and the use of FB Prophet, which is working better when there are strong 
 seasonality patterns. Since it's a time-series problem extra fetures like weather and vehicle type can not be included in this model. Another model that takes this features 
 into consideration could have been a choice, but, because of the seasonality factor, FB Prophet was chosen. The way that the weather data was treated on this analysis comes with 
 the assumption that, when it's raining the probability of a collision increases, which might not be the case or might have a smaller correlation. Further, a more thorough analysis on the 
 weather conection to collisions can be made in a future project.""")
